subsampling:

    # When the workflow merges metadata from multiple
    # inputs, it creates a boolean column for each input to
    # indicate which input each record came from. A record
    # from the "usa" input will have a value of "yes" in a
    # column named "usa". The same record will have a column
    # for the "nextregions" input with a value of "no".
    custom_sample:

      # Limit the number of California records included in the
      # analysis to a reasonable but large number. Tune this

    # To understand transmission patterns within the US that
    # led to introductions to California, we select a subset of USA

      # These group-by columns attempt to evenly sample across
